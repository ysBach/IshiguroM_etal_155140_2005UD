This repo is intended to store all the archive codes and part of the results of **(155140) 2005 UD** observation at Seoul National University Astronomical Observatory 1-m telescope on 2018-10-12 & 2018-10-13, which are published in **Ishiguro M. et al. 2019** (in prep).



**NOTE**

I decided not to upload the results and the explanation PDF files because the paper is not submitted yet. I will upload these before the final publication. (Currently they're at the local repository but I haven't yet ``add``/``commit``/``push``'ed.)



## Notebooks

Notebooks are made to give you how I reduced the data.

Note, however, that because I am not a well trained coder, it's messy. Especially because I don't know how to deal with the **memory leak problem** of ``matplotlib`` (or is it ``astropy``?), I had to halt the program from time to time and re-run the notebook, as the memory gets full after few hundred images were analyzed. Thus, especially the outputs in ``Photometer`` is not what you'll get if you run everythin from the beginning. Please refer to ``phot_log_all.txt`` to see all the outputs (I copied-and-pasted outputs from each run). **I know it's crazy** but this was the best way I could find (facepalm). If you know a better way, please let me know. I'll be more than happy.

## Data Analysis Strategy

1. **Centroiding**. I haven't yet found perfect algorithm to do centroiding, and I guess IRAF has some highly subjectively tuned internal algorithm for the centroiding which I haven't found. From short experience, I found elliptical Gaussian fitting for a centroid box of ``cbox = 8 * FWHM_initial_guess``. In this code, I did put ``mask = data < data.min() + 5*ssky``. For each iteration, new Gaussian fitting is done for ``cbox``-sized box, and the centroid position is updated. If the distance to the new centroid from the old one is larger than 1/2 FWHM, move only 1/2 FWHM to that direction. Halt the iteration when shift is << 1 pixel, and iteration is done up to 10 times only.

2. **FWHM**. It's difficult to find the true FWHM from non-sidereal tracking mode, since stars are trailed. What I did is, after the centroiding to the field stars (PS1 catalogued stars) as described above, get the sigma_y (minor axis) values of the fittings, and get sigma-clipped average of that. And regard ``2*sqrt(2)*sigma_y`` as the FWHM. In reality, trailed PSF (e.g., trailed Gaussian) is rather pill-box shaped and thus the Gaussian fit may be different from the real one. See VerešP+ 2012 AJ ([ads](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PASP..124.1197V/abstract)) and Fraser+2016 ([paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151..158F/abstract), TRIPPy [github](https://github.com/fraserw/trippy)).

3. **Target Aperture**. For target, I used circular ``r_ap = 1.75*FWHM`` aperture. The sky annulus is defined as inner and outer radii by 4 and 6 FWHM, respectively. Normally it is recommended by classical IRAF to use ``r_ap = max(3, f_ap*FWHM)`` for ``f_ap=1.5`` to ``3`` depending on the user's preference. The reason for minimum 3 pixel radius is because IRAF uses approximated aperture sum and if ``r_ap < 3``, the non-random error in aperture photometry gets larger than about 0.1 mag (for 1 pixel radius, it gets up to 0.5 mag error). As python or IDL codes has no such problem, I didn't put lower limit on aperture. Also 1.75 is selected by my experience using the SNUO 1m telescope.

4. **Star Aperture**. Since stars are trailed, I developed a code to do *pill-box aperture* photometry. It consists of two half-ellipses (a=major, b=minor, theta=angle) with one rectangle (width=trail length, height=b of the ellipse, theta=theta of the ellipse). The theta is obtained from the sigma-clipped mean value of 2D Gaussian fits as I used in FWHM estimation above. The trail length is simply obtained from ephemerides, and a = b = 1.75 FWHM is used. If you see the aperture overplotted on stellar objects, you realize it is too large compared to visually acceptable aperture. I intended this because the tracking error sometimes make the stellar PSF be U- or V-shaped, so non-negligible stellar fluxes were lost for some images while target flux does not. Thus, sacrifising the photometric accuracy of stellar photometry, I enlarged aperture sizes.

5. **Catalog Magnitude**. The PS1 query was done by VizieR (only has PS1 DR1 data, though DR2 is already available). The conversion from PS1 filter to Johnson-Cousins R filter was adopted from Tonry et al. 2012. Only stars with PS1 r-mag between 10-15.2 were used with n_observation in PS1 >= 3(r), 3(g), 1(i). Extended objects were removed by one of the simplest method recommended by Pan-STARRS. 

   > For details which can be subjective, please see the ``Photometer`` in the zip file and the source codes in the package ``ysphotutilpy`` (``ysphotutilpy.queryutil.PanSTARRS1`` and its methods ``drop_for_diff_phot``, ``select_filters``, ``check_nearby``, ``drop_star_groups``. I tried to explain as detailed as possible in the source codes.)

6. **Standardization**. The standardization was done by comparing the R-instrumental mag (R_inst) and catalog mag (R_cat) of the field stars. The linearity curve (R_inst VS R_cat) and its residual, as well as the color-term plot (R_cat - R_inst VS g_PS1 - r_PS1) were used to visually inspect whether the stars were selected well.

7. **Visual Inspection**. It's virtually impossible to look at each image thoroughly. Thus, I let my source code to draw "report figure" for each star and target. Then automatically generate report LATEX files and compile them. While looking at the generated report PDF file, I found some images failed in correct centroiding or some coding bug, because (1) my code is not perfect yet, (2) objects were too faint to be fitted correctly, etc. This kind of "error-rate" is which I should resolve in the future, but for now I just ignored them (2 images had unexpected serious problems which I cannot find reason).

8. **Data Goodness**. For the light curve below, "good" means (1) visually not affected at all (even ``serious = 1`` are removed) and (2) ``zpStd < 0.04`` is used as just a heuristic criterion.



If you need, I can provide all the data (original, combined calibration frames, reduced object frames, etc) and intermediate products for your reference. All files are already uploaded to my personal web cloud.
